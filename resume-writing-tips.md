# Resume Writing Tips & Best Practices

## üìù How to Use Your Resume Template

### 1. **Header Section**
- Use your full professional name (no nicknames)
- Include a professional email address (avoid funny or unprofessional emails)
- Add your LinkedIn profile URL (make sure it's updated)
- Include your GitHub/portfolio if relevant to the role
- Use your city and state/country (full address not necessary)

### 2. **Professional Summary**
- Keep it to 3-4 sentences maximum
- Focus on your most relevant experience and achievements
- Tailor it for each job application
- Use keywords from the job description
- Quantify achievements when possible

**Example:**
> "Experienced Full-Stack Developer with 5+ years building scalable web applications using React, Node.js, and Python. Led development teams of 4+ engineers and delivered 15+ successful projects, increasing user engagement by 40%. Passionate about clean code, test-driven development, and mentoring junior developers."

### 3. **Professional Experience**
- **Use the STAR method:** Situation, Task, Action, Result
- **Start with action verbs:** Led, Developed, Implemented, Optimized, Created, Designed
- **Quantify everything:** Use numbers, percentages, dollar amounts
- **Focus on achievements, not just responsibilities**
- **Tailor bullet points** to match the job you're applying for

**Strong Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "Developed a React-based dashboard that reduced customer support tickets by 30%"
- ‚úÖ "Led a team of 6 developers to deliver a $2M project 2 weeks ahead of schedule"
- ‚úÖ "Optimized database queries resulting in 50% faster page load times"

**Weak Examples:**
- ‚ùå "Responsible for developing web applications"
- ‚ùå "Worked on various projects"
- ‚ùå "Helped with team coordination"

### 4. **Technical Skills**
- **Group by category** (Languages, Frameworks, Tools, etc.)
- **List only skills you can confidently discuss** in an interview
- **Prioritize relevant skills** for the specific role
- **Consider skill levels** if helpful (Proficient, Experienced, Familiar)

### 5. **Projects Section**
- Include 2-3 most impressive and relevant projects
- **Explain the problem** your project solved
- **Highlight your specific contributions**
- **Mention technologies used**
- **Include metrics or results** when possible
- **Provide links** to live demos or GitHub repos

### 6. **Education**
- Recent graduates: Include more details (GPA if 3.5+, relevant coursework, projects)
- Experienced professionals: Keep it concise
- Include relevant certifications and bootcamps

## üéØ Tailoring for Each Application

### Research the Company & Role
1. **Study the job description** - identify key requirements and keywords

3. **Adjust your professional summary** to match their needs
4. **Reorder bullet points** to highlight most relevant experience first
5. **Customize your skills section** to emphasize technologies they use

### ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Optimization
- **Use standard section headings** (Experience, Education, Skills)
- **Include keywords** from the job description naturally
- **Use standard file formats** (PDF or Word)
- **Avoid complex formatting** that might confuse ATS systems
- **Use full technology names** (JavaScript instead of JS)

## üìè Length and Formatting Guidelines
